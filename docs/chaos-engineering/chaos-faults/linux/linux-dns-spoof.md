title: Linux DNS Spoof
---
Linux Dns Spoof injects chaos to mimic DNS resolution in linux machine.

## Use cases

- Induces DNS spoof on the target Linux machines.
- It resolves DNS target host names (or domains) to other IPs provided as user input.

:::note
- This fault has been tested for compatibility in Ubuntu 16 or higher, Debian 10 or higher, CentOS 7 or higher, RHEL 7 or higher, and openSUSE LEAP 15.4 or higher.
- The `linux-chaos-infrastructure` systemd service should be in an active state and the infrastructure should be in a `CONNECTED` state.

### SpoofMap

It defines the map of the target host names. For example, '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}' where the key is the host name that needs to be spoofed and the value is the host name to which the key is spoofed (or redirected). Tune it by using the `spoofMap` input.

Use the following example to tune the spoof map:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/linux-dns-spoof/spoofMap.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# target host names for spoofing
apiVersion: litmuchaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: LinuxFault
metadata:
  name: linux-dns-spoof
  labels:
    name: dns-spoof
spec:
  dnsChaos/inputs:
    spoofMap: '{"abc.com":"spoofabc.com"}'
```
